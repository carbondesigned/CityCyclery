                            <p>The City Cyclery&apos;s modest beginnings were first established by a few local &apos;vintage bike nerds&apos;.</p> 
                            <p>Initially, when a few friends figured out they were all secretly vintage bike nerds, Chris Holt came up with the idea of starting a Wheelman Club, the like &apos;olde&apos; days of cycling and they quickly filled up his garage with vintage rusty bikes.</p>
                            <p>Chris, along with Andrew Foot and Ron Drouillard, started &apos;aoldbikes.ca&apos; and posted a few of their restorations online- initially just to show off- but very soon, people were interested in buying the newly restored bicycles.</p>
                            <p>From this, Ron rented a small 500 square space in an alley off Chilver Rd in Walkerville.</p>
                            <p>This was originally a clubhouse for the Wheelman Club, but it quickly evolved into something much bigger.</p>
                            <p>Chris and Ron established the City Cyclery and were fortunate to quickly employ Mike Beauchamp as the head mechanic.</p>
                            <p>Over the last 10-12 years, the City Cyclery has been on the move and experienced some changes.</p>
